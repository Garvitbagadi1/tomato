# 🍕 Full-Stack Application Architecture – README

This README explains the architecture shown in the diagram, covering CI/CD, user roles, frontend, backend, and database.

---

## 📦 *1. CI/CD Pipeline*

The project uses an automated CI/CD pipeline to streamline development and deployment.

### *Features:*

* ✔ *Automated Testing* for quality assurance
* 🚀 *Multi‑environment Deployment:*

  * *Dev* (Development)
  * *Staging* (Pre‑production testing)
  * *Production* (Live environment)

This ensures code is tested and validated before reaching users.

---

## 👥 *2. User Roles*

The system supports multiple user types with different permissions:

* *Customer* – Places orders and manages cart
* *Admin* – Manages the system, users, menu, and orders
* *Inventory Manager* – Handles inventory‑related processes

---

## 🖥 *3. Frontend*

The application UI is built using:

* *ReactJS / NextJS*

Frontend interacts with backend APIs via secure requests.

---

## ⚙ *4. Backend*

Backend services expose REST APIs to the frontend.

### *Tech Options:*

* *Node.js*
* *FastAPI* (Python)

### *Features:*

* REST API with *API Key Authentication*
* Handles business logic, validation, and communication with database

---

## 🗄 *5. Database Structure*

The system stores key information in the database.

### *Entities:*

* 👤 *Users* – authentication, profile, roles
* 🍕 *Menu* – items available for ordering
* 🛒 *Cart* – user‑specific temporary selections
* 📦 *Orders* – completed purchase details

---

## 🔄 *Complete Workflow*

1. User interacts with the *Frontend* (React/NextJS).
2. Frontend sends requests to *Backend REST API*.
3. Backend processes logic and accesses the *Database*.
4. CI/CD pipeline ensures smooth development → staging → production deployment.

---

## 📘 Summary

This architecture represents a modern full‑stack, scalable application with:

* Automated CI/CD
* Role‑based access
* Modern frontend and backend frameworks
* Clean API‑driven communication
* Well‑structured database design

Perfect for e‑commerce, ordering systems, or any role‑based application.
